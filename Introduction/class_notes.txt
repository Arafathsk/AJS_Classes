What is AngularJS
-----------------

	- AngularJS is the Client Side JavaScript

Framework.

	- AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

M - Model

Ex.
	var data = "data from database soon....!";


[Note : where "data" variable called as model in angularjs]


V - View

	- we can use HTML / HTML5 as the View in AngularJS.


C - Controller

	we can call JavaScript Functions as the Controller

        in angularJS.


Ex.
	function my_fun(){

		//Logic Goes Here
	}





[Note : where "my_fun()" called as Controller in 
	angularJS]


Advantages Of AngularJS:
------------------------

1. AngularJS Supports Modules.
	(Predefined Modules && Custom Modules)


	- ngAnimate
		- this module used to develop the Animations
		  in angular applications.


	- ngMessages
		- this module used to handle the client side
                  form validations.
		
	- ngStorage
		- this module used to work with the Storages.

		- we have two types of storages.

			1. local storage

			2. session storage
		local storage:
		--------------

			- as a developer we must destroy the local storage
	         	  explicitely

			- local storage is the permanent storage.

			- we can save maximum "5MB Data" in local storage		

		session storage:
		----------------

			- when ever we "close the browser" or 
			  "opens the new tab"
                          data will be lost from session storage.

			- session storage is the temparary storage.
			
			- we can save maximum 5MB Data in Session Storage.


		ngRoute:
		--------
			- it is used to implement the Routing in
                          Single Page Application.
			
			- ngRoute Module is the Default Module
                          (Native Module).

			- now a days "no project" using ngRoute Module
			  
			- "ngRoute" Module is the Deprecated Module.

		ui.router:
		----------
			- this module used to implement the Routing
                          in Single Page Application.

			- ui.router module is the 3rd party module.

			- now a days all most all the projects using
			  ui.router module because of it's advantages.

		

Ex.
	implement the angular application with following features.

		1. Client Side Form Validations   (ngMessages)

		2. Storages Support		  (ngStorage)

		3. Animations Support		  (ngAnimate)

		4. Single Page Applications	  (ui.router) 
		   by using 3rd party Module.
		
		
index.html
----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="app">

	<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/
	             angularjs/1.6.0/angular.min.js"></script>


	<script>
		var obj = angular.module("app",["ngMessages",
				      "ngStorage",
				       "ngAnimate",
					"ui.router"]);
	</script>
</html>


		
2. Open Source Code

	- As per our project Requirement we can customize the 
	  framework

		Ex.
			adding the features
			modifying the features
			deleting the features
				--
				--
				--	

3. Two Way Data Binding.

	- Automatic Data Synchromization Between Model and View
with the super vision of controller called as Two Way Data Binding.




in the above diagram we have following server calls
----------------------------------------------------
1. http get request

	- this request used to fetch the data from the database.


2. http delete request

	- this request used to delete a perticular resource from
database.


3. Ajax Request
	- this server call used to overcome the data in consistency
between view and database.



[Note : as a programming languages developer we must make above
        all server calls to meet application requirement

	1. http get request
	2. http delete request
	3. ajax request

]


[Note : as a angular developer we can make only two server calls
	to meet application requirement because of "two way data
        binding".

	1. http get request
	2. http delete request
]


[Note : two way data binding reduces the burden on server]


4. As a angular developer we can directly perform the
   manipulations on DOM.

	 - DOM Stands for Document Object Model.

Ex.
	copy the data from one div to another div by using
	HTML & JavaScript.


	As a HTML Developer we can manipulate the DOM by using
	JavaScript.




Ex.
	copy the data from one div to another div by using
	AngularJS.



- angular framework (angular.min.js) starts the execution from
  ng-app directive.


- ng-model directive creates the object in heap memory with application
  data


- "ng-bind" directive binds the "model data" to view.

- as a angular developer we can manipulate the DOM by using
  angular directives


Disadvantages of AngularJS
--------------------------
	- understanding the angular applications are difficult
	  because of no coding standards given by google.


	- we are loosing the secuirity by using angularjs, because
	  we are implementing business components at client side.

	- client should enable the javascript.


key features of angularjs
-------------------------

1. single page applications

	- loading one template to another template without refreshing
	  the whole web page called as single page application.

	- by using angularjs we can implement the single page applications

	- we can implement the routing in single page application
	  by using following modules.

		1. ngRoute (Native Module)

		2. ui.router (3rd party Module)
